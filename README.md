8/29/25 First Blog post: 
This is my first blog post for my computer science class. I am a senior who plays tenor sax in the band. I have maintained good grades across all 4 years of highschool and I am currently on track to graduate with valedictorian. I plan to major in compsci at UT Austin and if that doesnt work I plan to major in mathematics. I am a member of the green club and was a member of TAFE for the last 2 years. Outside of school I have been in boyscouts for almost 11 years and am on track to reach eagle before I turn 18. I am also a member of NHS though we have not done much yet. The year has not been very difficult yet though my HCC classes start next week so the real school year will begin soon.
